# FDF [125/125]
This project at UNIT Factory (School 42) is about creating a simplified 3D graphic representation of a relief landscape.

Basically, my goal was to code program that takes data from a file and based on this data draws figure.

My FDF can rotate this figure in any angle.

You can find test maps in test_maps dir. Also, you can drow your own.

Launch example: ./fdf ./test_maps/42.fdf

If you your system do not have mlx lib, you can include it (use stuff into mlx dir).

Project is done in accordance with school norms (you can see them in Norme pdf).

Task requirement you can read in Subject pdf.

Have fun!
